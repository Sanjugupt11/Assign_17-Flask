    "Q3. What is App routing in Flask? Why do we use app routes?\n",
    "Answer:-\n",
    "App routing in Flask refers to the process of mapping URLs to functions in a Flask application. In other words, \n",
    "it is the process of defining which function should be executed when a particular URL is requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask uses a decorator called @app.route to define the URL routes in a Flask application. For example, the following\n",
    "code defines a route that maps the URL /hello to a function called hello_world:\n",
    "When a user visits the URL http://localhost:5000/hello in their web browser, Flask will execute the hello_world function and return the string \"Hello, World!\".\n",
    "\n",
    "App routing is an essential feature of Flask because it allows developers to create web applications with multiple\n",
    "pages or endpoints. By defining app routes, developers can organize their application logic into separate functions\n",
    "and easily map URLs to those functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to defining app routes, Flask provides many other features that make it easy to build web applications,\n",
    "such as support for templates, form handling, and user authentication. By using these features in combination with\n",
    "app routing, developers can create powerful and flexible web applications with Flask.\n"
